**Automated Multi-Host Tomcat Deployment**

**Objective:** Automated Tomcat server deployment across multiple hosts with cross-platform support.

**Components:**

1. OS-specific scripts: RPM-based (CentOS/RHEL) and Debian-based (Ubuntu) Tomcat setup

2. Remote deployment orchestrator: Distributes and executes scripts on target hosts

3. Host inventory file: Contains list of target servers for deployment

**Features:**

1. Auto-detects OS type and uses appropriate package manager

2. Remote script execution via SSH

3. Bulk deployment across multiple servers

4. Consistent configuration regardless of target platform

**Use Case:** Streamlines Tomcat provisioning for web applications across heterogeneous infrastructure environments.
